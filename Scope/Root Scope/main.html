<!--All applications have a $rootScope which is the scope created on the HTML element that contains the ng-app directive.-->
<!--The rootScope is available in the entire application.

If a variable has the same name in both the current scope and in the rootScope, the application use the one in the current scope.-->

<!--Example-->
<!--A variable named "color" exists in both the controller's scope and in the rootScope:-->

<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>
<body ng-app="myApp">

<p>The rootScope's favorite color:</p>
<h1>{{color}}</h1>

<div ng-controller="myCtrl">

<p>The scope of the controller's favorite color:</p>
<h1>{{color}}</h1>

</div>

<p>The rootScope's favorite color is still:</p>
<h1>{{color}}</h1>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.run(function($rootScope) {
    $rootScope.color = 'blue';
});
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.color = "red";
});
</script>

<p>Notice that controller's color variable does not overwrite the rootScope's color value.</p>

</body>
</html>
