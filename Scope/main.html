<!--Scope is an object that refers to the application model. 
It is an execution context for expressions. 
Scopes are arranged in hierarchical structure which mimic the DOM structure of the application. 
Scopes can watch expressions and propagate events.-->

<!--When you make a controller in AngularJS, you pass the $scope object as an argument:-->

<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">

<h1>{{carname}}</h1>

</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.carname = "Volvo";
});
</script> <!--The property "carname" was made in the controller, and can be referred to in the view by using the {{ }} brackets.-->

</body>
</html>
